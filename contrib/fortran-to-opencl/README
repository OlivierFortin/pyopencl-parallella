Experimental Fortran-to-OpenCL translator
-----------------------------------------

This is a highly experimental Fortran-to-OpenCL translator. Its purpose is to
translate computational kernels into OpenCL-like C. It doesn't
auto-parallelize. My purpose in writing this was to convert a few
special-function evaluators.

The best it can hope for at the moment is to automate most of the process so
that you'll only have to fix up a few things manually afterwards. It further
only deals with the subset of Fortran 77 that I needed. Quite a number of
things are unimplemented.  Patches are welcome.
